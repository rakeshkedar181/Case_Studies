# **Problem Statement**

The problem that we will solve is the same one we encountered in the decision tree course(link) related to the banking sector. Just to refresh, the problem statement is as follows: A bank has put out a marketing campaign and wants to know how the campaign is working. Given the features of the client and the marketing campaign, we have to predict whether the customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not. To get a deeper understanding of the problem, you can read more about the problem here.
